                    <p>My name is Sagar Maharjan, I am excited about everything that includes programming and I love working with new technology. I'm a passionate web programmer, currently working with Python and Django also I am currently giving Machine Learning a try. I don't have much of a code community and looking to grow my skill set and connect with all awesome developers out there. Looking forward to what's to come!</p>
                    <p>I created this web-app to share some of my thoughts and experience about programming. To be honest, I'm no Python/Django expert, but we all have something good to share.</p>
                    <p>What I like most about Python, and made me fall desperately in love with it, is how it focuses on writing clean and readable code. We all know how hard it can be to read other people’s code, especially if it is badly formatted.
                    Python tries to avoid that using rules and tips such as the functional imposition of nesting through indentation. This feature alone makes the code much more visual. While in many languages indentation is just a suggestion, in Python becomes a rule; either you indent or it does not work. If there is something that exemplifies perfectly what I’m just saying is the Tim Peters’ Zen of Python,, which is an easter egg that can be found in Python version 2.1.2 or later by typing

                      This tells a lot about the Python philosophy, and why I really enjoy writing code in Python. In fact, this
                      principles can be applied to any programming language. Writing good code, clear, readable, understandable depends
                      more on you than on the programming language you are working with.
                    </p>

                    <p>Steve Jobs stated once that <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/24/steve-jobss-best-quotes/" target="_blank">“simple can be harder than complex”</a>. And that's true. Requires a lot of hard work to get your thinking clean, to come up with a simple solution. But a simple solution is always better than a complex one.
                    </p>

                    <p>Simple communicates better. Simple creates a instant connection. Simplicity is something you can apply in everything in your life – not only programming.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stay humble. Be a simple person.</p>
